# Itertools_Combinations-iterable-r-
Turing Collage Problem Set

# String Combinations
This Python program takes a string and an integer value, and prints all possible combinations of the string up to a maximum size in lexicographic sorted order.

# Usage
To use the program, simply run the string_combinations.py script using Python 3, and enter a string and an integer value when prompted.

bash
Copy code
python3 string_combinations.py
The program will then print all possible combinations of the string up to the given size in lexicographic sorted order.

## Example
Suppose we want to find all possible combinations of the string "ABCD" up to size 3. We can run the program and enter the following input:

bash
Copy code
Enter string and integer value separated by a space: ABCD 3
The program will then output the following combinations in lexicographic sorted order:

css
Copy code
A
B
C
D
AB
AC
AD
BC
BD
CD
ABC
ABD
ACD
BCD

# Dependencies
The program requires Python 3 and the itertools module, which is included in the standard library.
